# RAHA – Roni's Adjusted Hybrid Average

**Developed by Aharon Roni Pesach**

RAHA (Roni's Adjusted Hybrid Average) is a statistical formula designed to compute a robust average while penalizing outliers—both high and low. It is especially useful in educational grading systems, financial modeling, and any context where extreme values may distort a fair representation.

## 🔢 Formula Description

RAHA adjusts the impact of outliers by blending:
- The weighted average (mean)
- A trimmed average (removing extremes)
- A hybrid of both, based on configurable weights

## 📊 Example Calculation

Given the following values and weights:

| Value | Weight |
|-------|--------|
| 80    | 10     |
| 80    | 15     |
| 70    | 15     |
| 75    | 10     |
| 80    | 10     |
| 90    | 15     |
| 70    | 10     |
| 60    | 15     |

The RAHA result combines the weighted average with an adjustment mechanism to reduce the influence of outliers.
